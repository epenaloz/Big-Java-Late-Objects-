/*
Programmer:  Enrique Penaloza

P7.2:   Write a program that reads a file containing text. Read each line and 
send it to the output file, preceded by line numbers.
        
EX: If the input file is:
        Mary had a litle lamb
        Whose fleece was white as snow.
        And everywhere...

    then the program produces the output file
         1  Mary had a litle lamb
         2  Whose fleece was white as snow.
         3  And everywhere...
